We are well aware that those who encounter data science terminology for the first time technically are bound to face a situation of overwhelming stuffs. It happened with us as well.</br>
So, we the Caasandra Coordinators will try to treat your wounds :slightly_smiling_face:. We will initiate the same process in wich you should come across different terminologies when anyone begins their journey in the field of Data Science.

### 1. What is DATA and DATA SCIENCE:

Data is nowadays referred to as the new fuel for industries as companies using it to analyse their sales and other stuffs.

- [Different type of data formats used in Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/guide-to-file-formats-for-machine-learning-columnar-training-inferencing-and-the-feature-store-2e0c3d18d4f9)

### 2. Data Science Languages

Most of us have been introduced to programming languages like C/C++, Java as Fast Languages and used in field of Software Development yet in Data Science speed matters but testing new Algorithms fastly matters the most. Therefore Python and R libraries have an extra edge over C++ due to it's simplicity for fast prototyping hence, 

<p align = "center">

</p>

we will stick with Python for testing new algorithms that we need to apply in Data Science field or specially in this event.

### 3. Data Science Tools

While exploring the world of Data Science, a person comes across numerous libraries like - 

<p align = "center">
<img width = 800 height =300 src = "assets/ds.jpeg"/>
</p>

It is difficult to go through each and every library but we will try to cover most of them in a very detailed manner.

#### 3.1 Numpy

This is perhaps the most beautiful and simple library, and contribute extensively in adding charm to Python language as it is nearly used by everyone.

It covers all operations which we can imagine using a multidimensional array.

```diff
- Most of the above studd you will tend to forget, it is a natural phenomenon,
- no one expects that you will memorize everything, 
- just one thing is important that you understand which thing to apply when
- and then google search accordingly.
```

#### 3.2 Scipy:-
Scipy is also a library similar to numpy carry out linear algebra tasks and oftern termed as big brother of it as it contains more sophisticated optimization methods.
 - [Resource from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/scipy/scipy_intro.php)
 - [Netwon Raphson - An algorithm implementation in scipy](https://www.epythonguru.com/2020/10/newton-raphson-method-using-scipy.html) (P.S. -> [What is Newton Raphson](https://iq.opengenus.org/newton-raphson-method/))
 

#### 3.3 Pandas:-

Till now most of you listened the word of Pandas as a library making dataframes and make your life easier in preprocessing data. But most of you wanted more rigrous exercise on it (Mentioned by most of you in google forms).

Below I will share some of the things that we referred, But Again, it's not that you need to memorize anything, you just need to memorize that this and this can be implemented using pandas then at the time of work just google that code:-

- [Exhaustive tutorial to master pandas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS)
- [Pandas functions cheat sheet](https://towardsdatascience.com/my-python-pandas-cheat-sheet-746b11e44368)

#### 3.4 Plotting Libraries:-

As a data scientist or an individual who want to excel in data science, you must need to develop the knowledge of plotting, interpretation and presentation skills. For these, matplotlib and seaborn is your god :bow:. But for good plotting skills, you need to do a lot of hardwork by making several different kinds of plot for different dataset, then only you will be good in it.

**Resources for matplotlib and Seaborn**

- **Matplotlib vs Seaborn**:- A comparison of two - [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-matplotlib-vs-seaborn/#:~:text=Matplotlib%3A%20It%20is%20a%20Python,libraries%20like%20Numpy%20and%20Pandas.&text=Seaborn%3A%20It%20is%20also%20a,Matplotlib%2C%20Pandas%2C%20and%20Numpy.)
- **Insallation for Matplotlib**-  Use (conda install matplotlib or pip install matplotlib) in command prompt
- **Insallation for seaborn**- Type (conda install seaborn or pip install seaborn) in command prompt. 
- [Data Visualisation using Matplotlib and seaborn](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-visualization-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-)

Rest is upto pratice as no article will give you the art of interpretation, you will need to develop it slowly, code is very little and almost same with few changes, you just need to apply your brain.

#### 3.5 Sklearn:-
Now comes one of the most important libraries from the point of view of model fitting and Feature Engineering. It contains different types of algorithms one can imagine for machine learning applications.

#### 3.6 Optuna Hyperparameter Optimization
Optuna is a hyperparameter optimization tool which is based on the principal of [Bayesian Inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference#:~:text=Bayesian%20inference%20is%20a%20method,and%20especially%20in%20mathematical%20statistics.), due to this technique it is way more faster than Sklearn tuners and can run with gpu as well. 

Resource :- 
  * [optuna summary blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-your-model-awesome-with-optuna-b56d490368af)

  I am sharing only one resource because that was enough for us at our time, but if you want to delve deeper, then search on google and mostly on kaggle platform that includes a lot of examples about optuna.

#### 3.7 RAPIDS
**NVIDIA** Released ```God of Speed``` for Data Science which is RAPIDS library in python.
